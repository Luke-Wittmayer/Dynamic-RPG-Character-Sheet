# Dynamic-RPG-Character-Sheet

## Goals

The purpose of this project is to better familiarize myself with coding in html and javascript languages using a format I am passionite about, table top gaming. The intent is to create a dyanimcally updating character sheet primarily based on D&D 5e.

Current goals include:

* Create core systems required for dynamic RPG character sheet including stats, races, classes, ect all based on the D&D 5e players handbook.
* Format the working character sheet to be more visually appealing and digestable.

Future goals include:

* Reformat completed sheet to me more visually similar to standard D&D 5e character sheet.
* Create online storage to store character sheets instead of on local storage.
* Expand character sheet's base coding to be easily edited to other RPG system formats.

## Workflow

With this being a smaller project, changes will be commited directly to the develop branch. With this in mind commits will be small changes over all so as not to affect the larger code or cause any difficult to fix bugs.

## Technologies

Languages used include:

* html
* css
* javascript

I will be using VScode as my text editor.
